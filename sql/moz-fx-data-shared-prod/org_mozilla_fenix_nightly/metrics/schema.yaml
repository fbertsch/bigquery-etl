      description: 'The total amount of time that we could reasonably be checkerboarding.
        This is the union of two possibly-intersecting sets of time periods: The first
        set is that in which checkerboarding was actually happening, since by definition
        it could potentially be happening. The second set is that in which the APZC
        is actively transforming content in the compositor, since it could potentially
        transform it so as to display checkerboarding to the user. Combined with other
        information, this allows us to meaningfully say how frequently users actually
        enncounters checkerboarding.

        being drawn in a [COLD VIEW start

        up](https://wiki.mozilla.org/index.php?title=Performance/Fenix/Glossary).

        The methodology for determining this measurement is imperfect to simplify

        implementation. Issues may include:

        <br>-Including VIEW intents that aren''t valid so take code paths similar

        to MAIN (this is speculative)

        <br><br>

        See the `cold_main_app_to_first_frame` probe docs for other possible

        known issues and more details.

        <br><br>

        Around April 8, 2021 the implementation was refactored. Functionally, it

        should be the same but it''s noted just in case there are bugs.

        individual sizes directly as integers, it is currently desired to

        report the sizes according to certain size ranges.

        The "buckets" for reporting group sizes will be mapped as follows:

        * 2 tabs -> 1

        * 3-5 tabs -> 2

        * 6-10 tabs -> 3

        * 11+ tabs -> 4

        Where the reported number will be 1, 2, 3, or 4, accordingly.

        As an example, say a user has three groups of sizes 3, 6, and 15. The

        app will report 2, 3, and 4 when this metric is tracked.
